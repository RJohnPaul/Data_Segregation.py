## Simulating a Data Segregation System for Different Types of Flowers

Simulate a data segregation system for various flower types with this Python program. The program uses object-oriented principles to model different flower types and their characteristics.

## Features

- Base class for generic flowers with attributes like name, color, and petal count.
- Derived classes for specific flower types (e.g., Rose, Daisy, Lily) with additional attributes.
- Class for FlowerType to represent a category of flowers with a list to store instances of specific flowers.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and run the program:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FlowerDataSimulator.git
   cd FlowerDataSimulator
   python flower_data_simulator.py

## Flower Types
-Rose
-Daisy
-Lily

## Installation
No additional installation is required beyond cloning the repository.

## Examples
-Creating instances of specific flowers.
-Adding flowers to FlowerType instances.
-Displaying information about each flower type and its associated flowers.
